# avrlearn007-UART
Piotr Makulec, 04JA2025
This repo is a part of my AVR self-learning journey.
The code was written in C for ATmega328p (Arduino).
The code allows to establish UART communication using either RS232 or RS485.
In the main function value of the OSCCAL register changes periodically and is sent via UART and displayed on the computer terminal. A PL2303 USB<->UART converter is utilized to establish the connection.
